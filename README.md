dwm-setup
=========
My dwm setup, trying to keep it simple.

## Why ?
Some patches are quite hard to find/fix, might help some other users.

## Setup
I use DWM on gentoo (using the savedconfig flag), the emerge build system to maintain everything:
* config.def.h is in put in /etc/portage/savedconfig/x11-wm/dwm-6.1
* The patches go /etc/portage/patches/x11-wm/dwm-6.1/
